		Oklahoma Blue Thumb Reference Document

# Client
	The data will be submitted to a database hosted by MTU

# User Experience

	When the application loads, it asks the user for their devices location.  This is optional as it is only used to auto-fill some information.  If the user declines permission, they will have to input the information manually.

	From the first screen, the user will have a clear representation of what the app is as well as the owning company.  The only option from this screen is to create a "new log".

	The Application is broken down into eight pages:

1. Initial
2. Site Conditions
3. Observations
4. Bacteria
5. DO & pH
6. Nitrogen
7. Phosphorus
8. Volunteers

	A quick link to each page can be found in the left side drawer

### Initial / New Log

### Voluteers

	On this page, the user can input values for one or more volunteers by selecting the "add Volunteers" button or remove extra volunteers with the "remove volunteers" button.  For all displayed volunteers, the following iformation is require before submission:

Similar to the date field from the first page.  This value is an identifier for the time at which the log was sampled.
- Activity
- Hours

	Lastly, on this page there is a "send" button.  This button will send the log via email to the data administrator for the Blue Thumb Data team.
After submitting, the application returns to the home page to allow the user to create a new log.

# Developer Experience

#
				main.js


###
				When the App loads


				When the application loads, it first obtains the current date and time.

				It then finds the location of the host device.

###
				Submission


				When the "Submit" button is pressed, the app gathers information supplied.  The information is as follows:

New Log Page
- site_name
- wbid
- legal
- county
- date
- latitude
- longitude
- site_time
- sampler_1
- sampler_2

Site Conditions
- weather
- wind_spd
- wind_dir
- stage
- stage_qual
- secchi_depth
- air_temp
- water_temp

Observations Page
- clean
- manure
- unsightly
- foam
- detritus
- trash
- sig_algae
- fish_kill
- dead_animals
- iron_precip
- siltation
- flow_alter
- habitat_alter
- oil_film
- odor
- exotic_spp
- cattle
- other_obs
- obs_comments
- site_obs_none

				The app then sanitizes the data values listed above.

				After gathering and sanitizing information given from the user, the application now constructs two CSVs,
 one is a volunteer list, the other is for data points.

				After the CSVs are created, the application prepares an ajax call to send an email to the scientists in Oklahoma.

###
				External Function Calls


###
				switchScreen(String);


				function:

				&emsp;displays a subset of the data fields to give the illusion of navigating through separate pages.

				calls:

				&emsp;newLogBtn

				&emsp;&emsp;"New Log" button listener

				&emsp;navForwardBtn

				&emsp;&emsp;"Forward" navigation button listener.  This gets the ID of the current page, then increments the index of the page array.

				&emsp;navBackBtn

				&emsp;&emsp;"Back" navigation button listener.  This gets the ID of the current page, then decrements the index of the page array.

				&emsp;index.html

				&emsp;&emsp;called from side navigation bar for each page

###
				openNav()


				function:

				&emsp;displays a sidebar navigation menu

				calls:

				&emsp;called from 'index.html' in several locations

				closeNav()


				function:

				&emsp;hides the sidebar navigation menu

				calls:

				&emsp;called from 'switchScreen()'

				&emsp;called from 'index.html'

#
				volunteer.js


###
				When the App loads


				The application adds a button listener to the "Add Volunteer" button.

				The listener obtains a count of the current number of listed volunteers (up to 10), then adds some html for each of the volunteers.

				The html creates fields for additional volunteer information.

				After creating the html tags, the application saves the updated volunteer count.

				The application now adds a button listener to the "Remove Volunteer" button.

				this listener gets the volunteer count and removes the most recently added volunteer (decrementing the volunteer count appropriately).

##
				"mail" class


###
				prepareAttachment($path) function


				function:

				&emsp;Creates a file that contains the ajax request information

				params:

				&emsp;path the the file that will receive ajax information

				calls:

				&emsp;called from sendMail()

###

				function:

				&emsp;sets up the headers, addresses, receipients, and message for the email

				params:

				&emsp;$to:		email receipient

				&emsp;$subject:	subject of email
